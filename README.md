Part of The Odin Project curriculum

todos:
* Add +/- key : * -1 I think?
* Add floating point : probably a huge pain in the ass
    * parseFloat()
    * still limiting .length I think? 
    * Number(Number(input).toPrecision(this.maxDigits))
    * . button needs hooking up
    * . button needs to disallow second .
* Add keypress event listeners : simple enough
* Add backspace : slice length - 1
* More bug testing 
* maybe implement testing package?

Looks
* different key colors for ops

Bugs
* still haven't built the err handling - decouple controls except c and make c reinit controls

Nice to adds
* copy to clipboard button on currVal when hovered
