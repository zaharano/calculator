Add +/- key : *-1 I think?
Add floating point : probably a huge pain in the ass
                    parseFloat()
                    still limiting .length I think? 
                    use that function to round
                    . button needs hooking up
                    . button needs to disallow second .
Add keypress event listeners : simple enough
Add backspace : slice length - 1
More bug testing 
maybe implement testing package?
sprucing : different key colors
